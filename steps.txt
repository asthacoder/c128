bs4 (BeautifulSoup) is a python
module, which is famously used for
parsing text as HTML and then
performing actions in it, such as
finding specific HTML tags with a
particular class/id, or listing out all the
li tags inside the ul tags.


Selenium, on the other hand, is used
to interact with the webpage. It is
famously used for automation testing,
such as testing the functionality of a
website (Login/Logout/etc.) but can
be also used to interact with the page
such as clicking a button, etc.
